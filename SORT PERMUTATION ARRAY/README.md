## PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a permutation consisting of n numbers 1, 2, ..., n (a permutation is an array in which each element from 1 to n occurs exactly once).

You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose a subarray (contiguous segment) of this permutation and arrange it any way you want.
Note: You cannot choose the entire sequence at once.

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations described above to sort the permutation a in ascending order.

```bash
Input
Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases t.

The next 2*t lines contain the description of the t testcases.

Each test case consists of two lines of input.

The first line of each testcase contains an integer n - the size of the permutation.

The second line of the test case contains n distinct integers from 1 to n — the given permutation.

Constraints
1 <=t<= 2000

3 <=n<= 50


Output
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations described above to sort the array in ascending order.
```
