## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given an array A of n elements, every element appears twice in the array except for one element. Find the element that is uniquely present in the array.

In other words, there is one value that has a frequency of 1 whereas the rest has a frequency of 2. Find that particular element.

Added Constraint -> Do in O(1) auxiliary space and linear time complexity.

```bash
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the size of the array A.

The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) - The elements of the array A.


Output
For each test case, print the answer: The unique element.
